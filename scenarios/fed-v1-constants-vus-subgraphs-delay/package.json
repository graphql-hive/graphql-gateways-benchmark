    "description": "This scenario runs 4 subgraphs and a GraphQL gateway with Federation v1 spec, and runs a heavy query. All subgraphs have an intentional delay on replying, and this creates additional pressure on the gateway's memory. We are running a heavy load of concurrent VUs to measure response time and other stats, during stress. It measure things like memory usage, CPU usage, response times.",
